Comb Sort

Comb Sort Description:

Comb Sort is an improvement on bubble sort. where bubble sort looks a elements one by one comb sort uses a gap that breaks up the total amount of elements.
So instead of comparing every element one by one its now making multiple camparisons at the same time. It slowly making the gap smaller by 1.3 every iteration untill the gap reaches a size of 1,
thus making it a faster sorting algorithm than bubble sort.

Comb Sort time and space complexity:

Comb sorts worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) and best case is O(nlogn) with an auxiliary space of O(1).
